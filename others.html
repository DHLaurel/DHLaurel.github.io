    <p class="Heading2">
      I was interested to see just how many of my classmates listed religion and religious artefacts as media important to
      them. Of the individuals who discussed religion, it was also interesting how many were specifically Christian. My
      personal views entirely aside, here are some examples:

      <li><a href = "http://people.tamu.edu/~lutz_840746/">Alex</a></li>

    Music Providers
  </p>
    <p class="Heading2">
        Our generation is seemingly one that puts music at its core. It's important to me to know the voice my fellows
        subscribe to - and it seems very disconcerting therefore that so many of them seem to cling to the voices
        pushed on them by large corporations and monetary awards ceremonies. Nevertheless, here are some of the individuals
        whose tastes in music gave me hope:

      <li><a href ="http://people.tamu.edu/~easter97/">Amanda</a></li>

    </ul>

    Communication
  </p>
    <p class="Heading2">
      It surprised me to see how many individuals listed communication itself as a form of media - 
      to be honest, the thought hadn't even occurred to me. Upon reconsideration I realized how
      large a part of my life communication really is. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~hstewart/">Hunter</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~swhite/">Sarah</a></li>
    </ul>
