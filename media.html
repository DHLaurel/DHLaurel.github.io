    All About Writing!

    <p class="Heading2">
      Ever since I was a child around 6 or 7 years old, I knew I wanted to be a writer. My first attempt
      was the ever inspired "Zemikian's First Journey," loosely based in Welsh mythology and my favorite
      Lloyd Alexander series at the time, <u>The Chronicles of Prydain</u>. Writing sadly took a backseat
      in my life as I approached other endeavors with caution and curiosity. 
      <br>
      Nevertheless! I have rediscovered my passion largely in part to the inspiration of the gruesome
      H.P. Lovecraft. His and the works of many others cascade the list below to help give the reader a 
      better idea of what fantasies may fuel my twisted mind.
