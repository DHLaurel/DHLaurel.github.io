    <i>"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate 
      all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity,
      and it was not meant that we should voyage far." - H.P. Lovecraft, <u>The Call of Cthulhu</u></i>

    As a computer science student, I have learned much - as a human, I've learned more. During my time at Texas A&M,
    I'm grateful to say that I've not only learned many of the secrets to the universe, but also many of the questions
    I had no idea I'd even have to ask. With a major in computer science and minor in film studies and a desire to pursue
    a livelihood dedicated to writing many would say that I've wasted quite some time; however, I'd argue, as did Steve
    Jobs as well as several other life-students, that I couldn't possibly have spent my time any better. Computing
    has taught me many things (besides the now obvious notion that I couldn't possibly see myself at any of the 
    industrial powerhouses so readily exalted by the uninformed masses today): the importance of careful planning,
    the power of ambition and drive, the knowledge that the bridge between man and machine is constructed solely of time,
    and, perhaps most importantly, the idea that the human race is capable of so much more than we can even begin to
    fathom at this stagnant era of inactivty and inert behavior.

    I once forgot how to swim as a young child, not because my arms and legs had forgotten which motions to perform, 
    but because I had developed a new fear. How could I possibly hold my breath while simultaneously using both of my
    arms to propel myself forward? I would dip my head and quickly shoot it back up as the thought of water filling my
    lungs flooded my mind. I had gained in the time since I had last swum new knowledge, new understanding, and 
    new fear of my surroundings. Before I was stung by a bee I had no reason to avoid the curious yellow flies which
    I only knew were responsible for bringing me honey.
