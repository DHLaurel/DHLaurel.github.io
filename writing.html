      <u>The Terror at Brickhaven</u>
    </p>

        <i>"...The symbol was a star, though it had more parts than just a star.
          It contained in it several triangles of different shapes and each could 
          have possessed their own soul but together, it was an entanglement of life 
          and death, a metaphor perhaps understood in those ways which even words 
          could not express. In the middle of the star stood a single open eye, whose 
          strange markings which encircled it seemed to dance before me. The eye on its own 
          caused a dread feeling deep inside me, bearing some form of life to the point that I 
          became afraid to look away in case it might blink."</i>

        <i>"...Aside from the relentless patter of rain on everything within earshot, 
          there were no sounds emanating from Brickhaven. The town seemed a desolate heath in 
          absence of all activity. The houses, however, were most definitely inhabited, and with 
          the lack of human presence anywhere in sight, it was most certain that Brickhaven's 
          inhabitants must have occupied at least one of the buildings I could see. The shutters 
          had all been drawn and the town remained to me a void of life."</i>

      <u>A Man and a Weather</u>
    </p>
        <i>"I have always been a man tempered at least in part by the passing weather. On those scornful days, 
          both hot and humid, do I find the utmost difficulty in holding on to the corners of my thoughts. Likewise, 
          on days whose wind chills my very bones do I feel an inexplicable exuberance wash over me – all means of 
          idea and plan are easily within my grasp, yet grasp for them I need not, for it seems they fall into my
          very open palms.
          <br>
          Indeed, it was this quality of mine which pushed me to opposition from an early age. On those days which 
          my fellows praised the skies above did I mourn and lament my ineffable disposition. Similarly, on the days 
          which the same fellows felt cursed by the wet and dreary mood forced upon them did I praise alone outside.
          <br>
          It was in these early days that I understood what it meant to feel exclusion. My thoughts were no less valid
          nor meaningful than those of my peers, and yet for holding an opinion which differed from theirs was I 
          ostracized and forced in form to mold to their wills. It was in these early days that I therefore developed mine
          own will – a will to do bidding on my own behalf and not on the behalves of those who so staunchly opposed me.
          It was in these early days that I learned to hoist shield in front of me and block out those opinions whose
          holders ne’er wished me well."</i>
