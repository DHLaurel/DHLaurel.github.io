      <u>The Terror at Brickhaven</u>

        <i>"...The symbol was a star, though it had more parts than just a star.
          It contained in it several triangles of different shapes and each could 
          have possessed their own soul but together, it was an entanglement of life 
          and death, a metaphor perhaps understood in those ways which even words 
          could not express. In the middle of the star stood a single open eye, whose 
          strange markings which encircled it seemed to dance before me. The eye on its own 
          caused a dread feeling deep inside me, bearing some form of life to the point that I 
          became afraid to look away in case it might blink."</i>

        <i>"...Aside from the relentless patter of rain on everything within earshot, 
          there were no sounds emanating from Brickhaven. The town seemed a desolate heath in 
          absence of all activity. The houses, however, were most definitely inhabited, and with 
          the lack of human presence anywhere in sight, it was most certain that Brickhaven's 
          inhabitants must have occupied at least one of the buildings I could see. The shutters 
          had all been drawn and the town remained to me a void of life."</i>
